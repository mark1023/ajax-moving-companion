# ajaxMovingCompanion
A website that gives you information about a city you wish to move to.

Written using html, css, javascript, and jQuery, this website was designed for practicing my AJAX skills using jQuery. It utilises Google's streetview API, the Guardian API, and the MediaWiki action API. Simply type your desired location in the form at the top of the page and hit submit to be shown Google's streetview of the house, along with any Guardian articles or Wikipedia pages associated with the city.
